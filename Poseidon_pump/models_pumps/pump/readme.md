The **pump_3_base** and **pump_3_carriage** models were used to create Pump 3.
The difference in the carriage models lies in the increased wall height, which allows for a more secure hold of the syringe.

The **pump_1_2_base** and **pump_1_2_carriage** models were used to create Pump 1 and Pump 2.
The difference in the base models is the increased height of the area where the pump is mounted.
